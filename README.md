# Tickets Create React App



You can now clone your repository locally and start making changes. Push your changes to automatically build and deploy the updated application!



### Live Demo
[http://pindorama.github.io/frontend-react-materiaui-typescript-app](http://pindorama.github.io/frontend-react-materiaui-typescript-app)

*GH Pages will only host static files, it's not your server (Json Server) to install libraries or run any code. so can't see the all page through github pages, i am looking for forwarding to deploy it in web server instead, that why  we can't see the all page through.

## Getting Started ðŸš€
Set up your local development environment by following these steps:

1.  **Install packages.**

```bash

yarn install
```

2.  **Start the development server.**

```bash
yarn start
```

The live development website should now appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3.  **Getting Started json server.**

```bash
yarn run json-server -w -p 3333 ./mock/database.json
# or
yarn mock
```


*GH Pages will only host static files, it's not your server to install libraries or run any code.

The live development website should now appear at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
